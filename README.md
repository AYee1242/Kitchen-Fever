Kitchen Fever is a cooking simulation that depicts the strenuous environment of a kitchen. 
The simulation involves four workers, each with their very own tasks and duties. 
Two of the chefs are responsible for cutting and cooking the meat and vegetables.
Another chef is responsible for plating the vegetables and meat components. 
The final chef is on dish duty and also plates the grain component. 
Each chef works on their own and may be completing different dishes from each other.
The user is given control over the cooking and cutting time of the chefs as well as what dishes the chefs must create. 
There are 2 different types of ingredients for each food group bringing a total 
of 8 different dishes that the user can choose from. 
Finally, the chefs run the risk of burning the food if it is left on the stove for too long.
When this happens, the chefs will run sporadically until the enture restaurant burns down
